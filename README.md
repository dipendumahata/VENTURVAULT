VENTURVAULT üöÄ
The bridge between Indian innovation and capital.

VENTURVAULT is a full-stack MERN application designed to be a comprehensive ecosystem connecting entrepreneurs, investors, advisors, and bankers in the Indian startup landscape. It's more than a marketplace; it's a platform for growth, featuring real-time deal rooms, dynamic role-based dashboards, and a marketplace for professional services.

‚ú® Features
This project is packed with features designed to create a seamless and valuable experience for every user role.

Core Platform Features:
Role-Based Authentication: Secure JWT-based authentication for four distinct user roles: Business Owner, Investor, Advisor, and Banker.

Real-time Notifications: Instant updates for key events (like an investor showing interest) using Socket.IO.

Dynamic Dashboards: Each user role gets a unique, animated dashboard with relevant previews and actions.

Interactive Deal Rooms: A private, real-time chat room (with a WhatsApp-style UI) is created when a business owner accepts an investor's interest.

Professional UI/UX: A modern, premium design built with Tailwind CSS and brought to life with "God-level" animations using Framer Motion.

Role-Specific Functionality:

VENTURVAULT - Low-Level Design (LLD)
Version: 1.0 (Post-Deployment)
Date: August 14, 2025

1. System Overview
1.1 Project Description
VENTURVAULT is a full-stack MERN application designed as a comprehensive ecosystem to connect Indian entrepreneurs with investors, advisors, and bankers. The platform facilitates investment opportunities through proposals, a marketplace for professional services ("Gigs"), loan product listings, and secure, real-time communication channels ("Deal Rooms") to foster negotiations and partnerships.

1.2 Technology Stack
Frontend: React (with Vite), Redux Toolkit, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Axios, Socket.io-client

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with role-based access control (RBAC)

Real-time Communication: Socket.IO

Deployment:

2. System Architecture
We adopted a monolithic backend architecture for rapid development and ease of management, which is ideal for the current stage of the project.

2.1 High-Level Architecture
[Frontend: React on Vercel] <--> [API (REST & WebSocket)] <--> [Backend: Node.js on Render] <--> [Database: MongoDB Atlas]

2.2 Backend Folder Structure
/BACKEND
|-- /controllers  // Handles application logic for each route
|-- /middleware   // Auth (protect, authorize) and error handling
|-- /models       // Mongoose schemas for all database collections
|-- /routes       // API endpoint definitions
|-- .env          // Environment variables (secrets)
|-- index.js      // Main server entry point

2.3 Frontend Folder Structure
/FRONTEND
|-- /src
|   |-- /assets       // Icons and static assets
|   |-- /components   // Reusable UI components (layout, shared, role-specific)
|   |-- /context      // Socket.IO provider
|   |-- /pages        // Top-level page components
|   |-- /router       // React Router configuration
|   |-- /services     // Centralized Axios instance
|   |-- /store        // Redux Toolkit store and slices (authSlice, dataSlice)
|   |-- App.jsx       // Main application component
|   |-- main.jsx      // Application entry point

3. Database Design (MongoDB)
3.1 Collections & Schemas
users: Stores user authentication data and profiles.

email, password (hashed), role (enum: business, investor, advisor, banker, admin), profile (firstName, lastName, etc.), isVerified.

businessproposals: Stores proposals created by business owners.

businessId (ref: User), title, description, category, pitchDeck (object with problem, solution, etc.), healthScore, fundingDetails, status (enum: draft, published), interestedInvestors (array of refs: User).

advisorId (ref: User), title, description, price, category, deliveryTime, platformFee.

bankerId (ref: User), productName, loanType, interestRate (min, max), loanAmount (min, max).

dealrooms: Represents a private chat room between a business and an investor.

proposalId (ref: BusinessProposal), businessId (ref: User), investorId (ref: User), status.

chatmessages: Stores individual messages for each deal room.

dealRoomId (ref: DealRoom), senderId (ref: User), message.

PUT /proposals/:id/publish: Change a proposal's status to "published" (Role: business).

POST /proposals/:id/interest: Express interest in a proposal (Role: investor).

POST /proposals/:proposalId/accept/:investorId: Accept interest and create a Deal Room (Role: business).

Server Emits:

new_notification: Sent to a specific user when an event concerning them occurs (e.g., interest expressed).

new_chat_message: Broadcast to all members of a specific deal room when a new message is sent.

5. Frontend Design (React)
5.1 State Management (Redux Toolkit)
authSlice.js: Manages user authentication state, including user object, token, loading, error, and notifications. Handles async thunks for loginUser, registerUser, and fetchUserByToken.

dataSlice.js: Manages all application data. Holds state for proposals, gigs, orders, dealRooms, etc. Contains all async thunks for fetching and creating data.

5.2 Component Architecture
/pages: Contains top-level components for each route, such as HomePage, LoginPage, DashboardPage, ProposalDetailPage, and DealRoomPage.

/components/layout: Contains structural components like Navbar and Footer.

/components/dashboard: Contains components specific to the user dashboard, including ProfileCard, QuickActions, and the role-specific dashboard views (BusinessDashboard, InvestorDashboard, etc.).

/components/shared: Contains reusable components used across multiple pages, like AuthFormCard and NotificationBell.

5.3 Routing (react-router-dom)
Public Routes: /, /login, /register, /about, /careers, etc.

Protected Routes: All other routes (e.g., /dashboard, /my-proposals, /deal-rooms/:id) are wrapped in a ProtectedRoute component that checks for a valid user session in the Redux store.

6. Deployment Architecture
Frontend (Vercel): The React application is deployed on Vercel, connected directly to the GitHub repository for continuous deployment. A vercel.json file is used to handle client-side routing on refresh by rewriting all paths to index.html.

Backend (Render): The Node.js server is deployed as a Web Service on Render. It is also connected to GitHub for continuous deployment. Environment variables on the Render dashboard are used to securely store the MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET.

CORS: The backend is configured to only accept requests from the deployed Vercel frontend URL and the local development environment.
