VENTURVAULT üöÄ
The bridge between Indian innovation and capital.

VENTURVAULT is a full-stack MERN application designed to be a comprehensive ecosystem connecting entrepreneurs, investors, advisors, and bankers in the Indian startup landscape. It's more than a marketplace; it's a platform for growth, featuring real-time deal rooms, dynamic role-based dashboards, and a marketplace for professional services.
